# Homework #6

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Functions
-A function is a block of code that is kept together to form a specific function. For example, you could create a function to "add two numbers together", which would require two lines of code, one to add the numbers together and another to output calculation that is returned. This block of code needs to be assigned (=) to a function name so it can be called on again in the program i.e. var addTwoNumbersTogether() = function() {**code**}

	* Parameters & Arguments
-Parameters can be described as placeholders in functions, in which data can be passed into the function at the point of execution. So, the previous function we described could have have two parameters which would look like the following, addTwoNumbersTogether(x,y). x and y in this case are the placeholders for the two numbers we wish to add together, if addTwoNumbersTogether(5,5) was used then we'd have the number 10 returned from the code executed. These are also known as the function arguments which are required to be passed to the function during the point of execution.

	* `if` statements
-An if statement is used to determine whether a piece of code should run depending on whether requirements are met. For example, an IF statement could be used to check whether a number passed to a function called addTwoEvenNumbersTogether(); is in fact an even number if not. The number would be run past the if statement first, and if the number passed to the function is not an even number then an error message could be returned to the program.

2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.

4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.

5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.

6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
